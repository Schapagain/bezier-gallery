# Learn p5.js while making beautiful artwork

This is the stuff I did while I was learning the basics of the p5.js library. 

If you would like to see all the pieces I made, please check out the [gallery](https://bezier-gallery.netlify.app/). I also have an [article](https://zagzig.medium.com/making-digital-art-with-javascript-289d758f7dc) that walks through the process of making basic shapes on a canas - please feel free to check that out as well.
